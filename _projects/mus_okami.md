This was my second orchestral arrangement for Columbia Pops. Okami is what got me into arranging way back in middle school so it was very moving to get to conduct it and introduce people to the game! I'm especially proud of the Reset section. In the original piece, the same theme is repeated with variations in harmony and ornamentation line over 5-10 minutes; here, I managed to condense it down to about 70ish measures and there contrasting harmonies sound absolutely gorgeous.

The beginning of the piece is a long piccolo solo (after a euphonium-based introduction) based on a mixture of the Reset theme and the dizi solo in 牧民新歌 (more on that in a future post!). A brief introduction of the main theme of Reset follows, with the melody moving through the winds, before a caesura into Ryoshima Coast (apologies for the key signature), then Rising Sun,and finally returning to the grand version of Reset. 

This arrangement also uses Shakuhachi (played by one of the second flutes, although this can be moved over to first flute with some finagling) and an English Horn (played by the Oboe). Since English Horn is not in concert key, for readability's sake the portions played on English Horn (H to I) are written on the Oboe sheet in English Horn key (i.e. concert key G flat, written key D flat). 

## Sheet Music
Sheet music is available below. The numbers indicate how many musicians we had that semester on each part (and is thus what I wrote for), but can be adjusted to your liking. The auxillary percussion section is... poorly planned out. This piece is very percussion heavy, however, so do your best! Priorities are on bass drum (taiko if you can swing it!), piano, wood block, triangle, piano, and marimba. Ideally have everyone though: each part has the percussion feature at some point in the piece. The marimba part in particular is a bit tortuous, so another piano doubling it if necessary is okay.

A performance by Columbia Pops can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQWwQVOLoY&ab_channel=ColumbiaPops). Special thank you to soloists Nithin Chilakapati (Piccolo), Cheryl Yan (Shakuhachi), Emma Braunberger (English Horn), Matthew Kang (Clarinet 1), and Camilo Alvarez (Euphonium)!

## Rehearsal Notes

The piccolo solo is on a separate sheet. On the score and everyone else's part, the solo occupies 2 measures written. However, the solo itself is free-tempo, so don't conduct and let the piccolo show off!

Trumpets should drop an octave in Ryoshima Coast; it's really high so if they have other pieces they need their chops for this part is fine to take down an octave.
