My first arrangement with Pops was in Fall 2022. I chose Sound Euphonium, an anime which was influential on my growth as a musician in high school. I wrote this over the summer as I began my work as the Music Director for the orchestra.

The piece is divided into an introduction (up to C), the first half of the concerto theme (up to E), Dream Solister (up to I), and the second half of the concerto theme (until the end). Notably, we did not have any euphoniums that semester, so I placed the core euphonium themes into the 1st French Horn part. This ended up thinning out the horn section too much, so if possible, please move that part into your euphonium section.

## Sheet Music
Sheet music is available below in addition to ideal orchestration. The numbers indicate how many musicians we had that semester on each part (and is thus what I wrote for), but can be adjusted to your liking.

To listen to what it sounds like in a real orchestra, Columbia Pops's performance can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQWwQVOLoY&ab_channel=ColumbiaPops). In addition, the core theme of the piece is condensed into a Debussy-esque piano arrangement [here]((https://xiongshujun.github.io/assets/pdf/music/Sound_Euphonium_Theme_Debussy.pdf)). 

The Musescore3 file is available [here](https://xiongshujun.github.io/assets/pdf/music/Sound_Euphonium_v6.mscz). Unfortunately for most people, Musescore3 is my preferred arranging apparatus (not Sibelius or Musescore4) so please bear with the cumbersome playback. 

## Rehearsal Notes
The piece begins with a piano solo (and a dotted half note on F. Horn 1/Euphonium) with the flutes playing a thin overlaying line on top. It's very rubato, but the downbeat of each measure should be given to the pianos. In the measure before A, begin conducting in 4. The basses come in after 2 beats (i.e. basses come in 2 beats before A), then violas + cellos come in on A.

The viola part at A is really annoying. While it is advisable to conduct in 4 to keep it constant with the surrounding sections, the viola part is really playing in 6 over the 12/8 bar. I recommend singing it to them and it'll make a lot of sense (check the recording for what I'm going for).

At C and I, there's a transition from 6/8 bars in 3 to 2/4 bars conducted in 2. All the 12/8 sections after C are conducted in 4. Transitioning from 4/4 to 12/8 sections, conduct in the same tempo!

At D1, the patterns here are many-overlayed entrances for 2ish measures each that arc across up then down. When you get to the top of each phrase, start dropping in volume so that the next phrase can crest. Think of it like ocean waves washing over and over again!

Dream Solister can be conducted in 2 or 4 depending on your feel (I started out in 4 then at F, I transitioned to in 2 until the end of Dream Solister). The drumkit carries the tempo here, and I would highly recommend someone play the drum part. If necessary, this can be split into snare, bass drum, and standing crash cymbal or hi-hat. 

Cymbals at O are on the off-beats, which is crucial. Ideally the Grand Chimes also play out a lot here (unfortunately, we didn't have access to any). A mic'd piano is advisable throughout the piece in order to double that effect, but also to bring out the solo at the beginning of the piece. On that note, the piano solo at the beginning is rubato, so cue just the downbeat of each measure and let them play to their hearts content.

Whenever violins/violas have the little repeated dotted staccatos (m. 43 (D, 2nd violins + violas) and m. 170 (M, violins 1 + 2)), play like raindrops dancing on the rooftop. Same for Bass Clarinet and Bassoon at N.


## Reflections

I'm not super happy with the Dream Solister section in the middle; I overloaded the harmonies at the beginning and end of the section and the melody is hard to bring out because of that. The brass is also playing really, really high (a bad habit of mine) and it is advisable to take it down an octave. In addition, the trumpet-trombone duet attempts to mimic a euphonium-like sound but it doesn't work very well. I would swap this out for a clarinet/oboe and bassoon.

On a more positive note, I think the voicing in the final section is fantastic and the best I've ever done. This was a very fun experience learning how to get good at arranging!
