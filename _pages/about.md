I am an incoming 1st-year PhD student at NYU in the Neural Science program. My research focus is on . I am currently working with Dr. Owen Marschall in the [Litwin-Kumar Lab] (http://lk.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) on high-dimensional limit cycles. My broader research interests are in geometric representations in neural activity and applications to deep learning theory.
