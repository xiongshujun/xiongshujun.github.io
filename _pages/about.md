I am an incoming 1st-year PhD student at NYU in the Neural Science program. I am currently working with Dr. Owen Marschall in the [Litwin-Kumar Lab](http://lk.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) on high-dimensional limit cycles. My broader research interests are in geometric representations in neural activity and applications to deep learning theory.

Outside of school, I enjoy teaching debate (parliamentary/Public Forum), erhu performance and composition (you may catch me busking in a subway station!), and modern Chinese literature. Feel free to puruse the projects page for some of my creative work! I also volunteer with [Queer in AI](https://www.queerinai.com/) and the [Prison Math Project](https://www.prisonmathproject.org/). Please get in touch if you want to chat about applying theoretical work to effect real change!
