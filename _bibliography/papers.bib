  abstract = 	 {This paper presents the computational challenge on differential geometry and topology that was hosted within the ICLR 2022 workshop “Geometric and Topo- logical Representation Learning”. The competition asked participants to provide implementations of machine learning algorithms on manifolds that would respect the API of the open-source software Geomstats (manifold part) and Scikit-Learn (machine learning part) or PyTorch. The challenge attracted seven teams in its two month duration. This paper describes the design of the challenge and summarizes its main findings.}
